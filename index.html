                <p>According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, electricity accounts for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. Electricity generates the second largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of US energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from heating, cooling, and powering households. It is disheartening to know that most people don't realize that their daily household activities contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases. It is also observed that households don't receive high priority in climate policy strategies. Household behavior is an essential component in climate policies especially if the income is high.
                  Given this information, we want to come up with a solution to reduce the carbon emissions that takes place in the household.</p>

                                <h4>DESIGN QUESTION - Initial Iterations</h4>
                                <p>We started our primary research on the topic "low carbon future". As we continued with our research, we also started brainstorming ideas for the design question. We eventually decided to focus on electricity as it is the second
                                   largest source of greenhouse gases emission.<br>
                                   We noticed that there are buildings in Seattle and Bellevue that leave their lights on overnight. We wanted to understand what is the reason behind that and hence we came up with our first design question.
                                   <br> 
                                </p>
                                <h6>Design Question #1</h6><br>
                                <p>How can we encourage the managers of office buildings to reduce electricity consumption by
                                  reducing the number of lights left on overnight at office buildings in the Bellevue region and the
                                  UW-Seattle campus? <br></p>
                                <p>We had to address some important question that came along with this design question to proceed further. Some of the considerations were - <br>
                                1. What is the building have security reasons to leave the lights on?<br>
                                2. What is the building are using LEDs instead of tranditional candle bulbs?<br>
                                3. What is the overall lighting system?<br>
                                4. Who are our core users?<br></p>
                                <p>While answering the above questions, we realised that we are focusing on a topic that is broad and probably won't work for situations where steps are already taken to reduce carbon footprint.
                                  <br>
                                  We had to redefine our design question so we started from the beginning and realised it is important for us to focus on not just greenhouse gases emmision but also the problem at an individual level.<br>
                                  By doing so, we were able to come up with our second design question.<br>
                                </p>
                                <h6>Design Question #2</h6><br>
                                <p>How can we encourage residents in Spring District buildings to use energy rationally by
                                  exposing them to visual feedback and incentives in order to reduce carbon emissions? <br></p>
                                <p>We decided our target audience to be residents of Spring District because of the different living situaion. We observed that students, young working professionals and families live in Spring District
                                   which was an ideal location for us as GIX is location in Spring District.<br>
                                </p>
                                <p>We did have an issue with this design question. We included a solution in the design question which made it difficult for us to move forward with the solution, i.e- we included "visual feedback and incentives in order to reduce carbon emissions".<br>
                                So we had to redefine our design question without including a solution. <br></p>
                                <h6>Design Question #3 (Final)</h6><br>
                                <p>How can we raise awareness among residents of Spring District apartments about their carbon
                                  footprint and encourage them to use electricity wisely in order to decrease carbon emissions?</p>

                                <p>Our user research was divided into two part : field study and online survey. I decided to go with these two methods because it was important for us to first understand who our target users were and then proceed with their inputs on reducing electricity consumption and carbon footprint.
                                  <br>Before proceeding with the field study, we decided to ask permission from our target users and if they were not
                                  comfortable, we did not interview them. We were completely honest about the research and
                                  mentioned that it is for a course project. We did not mention the names of our participants
                                  we interviewed and we also removed any logos or faces that was present in the photos or
                                  videos.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h5>Field Study </h5><br>
                                <p>Each one of us visited different apartments in Spring District and observed our user's behavior. The field study took approximately 30 mins each apartment. It was essential for us to understand how our user's use electricity in their house and what measures they take to reduce their electricity consumption.</p>
                                <p>From our field study, we learned that our users sometimes chose to leave the lights on when they go out because they think
                                  the time duration is short. Secondly, we were able to observe that users choose not to take off their shoes and go indoors to turn off the lights. Because they feel taking off the shoes and wearing them back is a time consuming activity and also when they are in a hurry, this is not an option for them. <br>It was also observed that on an average, people pay $120-130 monthly in electricity bills.<br>
                                  With these findings, we decided to draft some specific question that our target users i.e - residents in Spring District will answer in the survey. </p>

                            <p>A major finding from our primary research was that different living situation had different levels of electricity consumption. To better illustrate those differences we created two user persona to represent our target users.<br><br></p>

                            <p>We started brainstorming possible solutions focusing on the design requirements and personas. I decided that we each come up with our own ideas and pitch it to each other and also discuss the pros and cons of each idea.
                               This way we could pick a design idea and combine some of the pros from each design (or) if nothing works out, we can come up with ideas together.
                               <br>To our suprise, we had one common idea amongst all the other ideas and that was a mobile application.<br> <br></p>

                            <p>During our brainstorming session, we came up with some unrealistic ideas but THAT'S OKAY. It gave us a clear direction as to what we need to focus.
                               We decided to create a mobile application that allows users to manage their electrical appliances and also keep track of their electricity consumption.
                                One of our teammate wanted to show the electricity consumption in the form of a histogram to make it easier for our users to understand.
                                I wanted our application to show the daily electricity consumption and give an approximate estimation of rate of electricity consumption and also give recommendations on 
                                how to consume energy rationally to reduce carbon footprint. As I come from an engineering background, I thought we could make a smart home system that will notify our users about any appliances
                                that are on and allow users to turn off
                                 their appliances using their mobile application. <br><br>

                            <p>To help us understand the feasibility of our prototype, we created scenarios. My scenario was life of a college student and a young working professional. 
                              Through this I wanted to understand if our users are able to use our solution and produce the expected results. <br>
                             Below are some of our scenarios: <br><br> </p>
                             <p>Scenario #1:<br>
                              One Sunday evening, you go downstairs to walk your dog, and after that, you wander
                              around. Suddenly, a push alert from SeeCarbon APP appears on your phone. Then you
                              notice that the app alerts you that your house is currently consuming too much energy. You
                              realize that you need to turn off some appliances to reduce household consumption.<br><br>
                              ●Task 1: You see a prompt to turn off your air conditioner, and you choose to click off.<br>
                              ●Task 2: You want to check which appliances are on now in the APP.<br>
                              ●Task 3: You want to turn off the TV in the APP.<br><br>
                              Scenario #2:<br>
                              Before going to bed at night, you lie in bed and open the SeeCarbon APP.<br><br>
                              ●Task 4: You want to check the current electricity bill for this month.<br>
                              ●Task 5: Because you know you use the most electricity today at noon. So you want to
                              check the electricity consumption from 11am to 12pm today.<br>
                              ●Task 6: You want to view the total home electricity consumption for this week.<br>
                              ●Task 7: You want to see the household electricity consumption for this Friday.<br><br>
                              Scenario #3:<br>
                              Imagine you are a college student, who has a busy schedule. You are rarely at your house since
                              you have to go to college and do part time jobs. You are extremely tired by the time you are back
                              home and it is usually 8-9pm. You just cook dinner and do basic chores with the help of the
                              electrical home appliances you have at your place.<br><br>
                              ●Task 8: Check if all the appliances and lights are off.<br>
                              ●Task 9: It’s time to check your daily consumption of electricity and the rates for the same.<br>
                              ●Task 10: Please follow the guidelines to reduce your electricity consumption since it is
                              greater than yesterday.

                                <p>Our participants were 4 graduate students from the UW. We were able to successfully get results
                                    for some of our previously mentioned scenarios because all 4 participants had different living
                                    situations. Each session latest about 30 mins. <br>
                                    Since our final solution is a mobile application, we decided to create a digital low-fidelity
                                    prototype to test the implementation of the application. The low-fidelity prototype was created
                                    on Figma, where each member of the team was able to add their ideas. Only the important
                                    features of the application i.e report of energy consumption, estimation of cost, estimation of
                                    carbon emissions, and recommendation on how to reduce electricity consumption and carbon
                                    emissions were added. We created necessary interactions (or connections) to allow our users to
                                    navigate through the app using prototype - interaction available on Figma. This allowed our
                                    users to experience a flow of interaction similar to how they would actually interact with the app
                                    in the real world.<br><br></p>

                    <p>Overall, I feel the project was a success. We did have some issues in the beginning with our design question
                         but we were eventually able to fix it and focus on one direction. As we narrowed our design question, our process became much easier.
                          There is definitely scope for improvement. There are many factors we did not consider for this project. We did not consider the business part for this solution.
                           We also did not consider the engineering part especially the hardware to make a smart home device. <br>
                           One of the most important part of the entire project was definitely user research and ideation. We learnt so much from our user behavior.<br>
                           Some places of improvement would be - my teammates were not able to communication their ideas properly due to language barrier and hence we did have issues and friction when it came to writing up the report and having a effective communication.
                            If I did this all over again, I would probably find another way to deal with this situaion. I would have found a much efficient way to get our work done.
                             In the beginning the entire process felt like a burden but eventually it got better and we were able to somehow function. It is surprising how we were able to achieve our end result. We definitely did a great job despite all the issues.

                             Some of my major takeaways from this project and course are :<br>
                             ● I thought design thinking was more of wireframes and working on improving/learning designing skills. But ever since the prompt was assigned, there is no similarity between what I thought DT was and what it is in reality.<br>
                             ● Always keep "User-Centered Design" in mind. The solution should always be based on real user data and thought through by design thinking.
                             <br>
                             ● Doing user research & Prioritizing user needs is CRUCIAL!<br>
                             ● I never had any experience with user research and user survey. Through this course, I was able to learn to understand user behavior, learn how to influence, and consider technical, business and design while keeping the user as the main focus. 
                             One thing that was challenging during the entire course was that every user had their own story, and coming up with a solution combining all the inputs was difficult.
                         <br>
                             ● Always be open-minded to explorations we find during the design thinking process.<br>
                             ● Always iterate!!Always iterate!!<br>
